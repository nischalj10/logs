        <h2>prologue</h2>
        i have been a software engineer, primarily working on the web for the last five years. <br/>
        started working with an esp32s3 chip for my latest startup for the last three months now. <br/>
        these very few months have been nothing less than revealing. <br/> 
        as a web dev guy, when you jump into embedded - it feels like your limbs have been cut off and you're still supposed to type code on a keyboard. <br/>
        but it has been one of the most fun experiences that i would want every engineer to have. <br/>
        the rawness of embedded systems make you appreciate all that is take so casually in modern engineering. <br/>
        you finally start to feel the weight on the giants whose shoulders we perch upon. or as sir issac newton wrote to robert hooke, “If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants” <br/> <br/>

        in web development - we have amazing build tools, hot module reload, component libraries, heck we so many amazing pacakage managers that feel like godsend when you jump into embedded programming. <br/>
        don't feel like i am writing this to scare off the folks who are entering new here, but i want you to know you will feel both incredibly powerful and stupendously dumb when working on processors like an esp32. <br/>

        <h2>the actual intro</h2>
        just to be clear, i am, by every means, to total noob in both web development and embedded systems. what i will try here is to give you a brief primer that hopefully eases in your journey. <br/>
