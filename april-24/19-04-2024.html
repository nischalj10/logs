    <h3>today : 19-04-2024</h3>
    <p>
        it's been around couple of weeks since i picked up deep learning again. last time i did it was back in college. <br/>
        i started with andrej's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0&list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ&pp=iAQB">nn-zero-to-hero series</a> and i couldn't be more thankful that this exists. <br/>
        for this entire week i have been trying to make a song generation model that generates hindi songs based on a text prompt <br/>
        this was quite a task to pick up given my non existent background in audio engineering + noivceness in DL. <br/>
        experimented a lot with <a href="https://github.com/lucidrains/audiolm-pytorch">AudioLM repo by lucidrains</a> but couldn't get it to run reliably on multi GPU training. <br/>
        also, i hate any and all kind of online dev IDEs - they all are super slow and suck so hard <br/>
        experimented a lot with <a href="https://github.com/suno-ai/bark/">bark from suno ai</a> and also tried finetuning it with hf transformers. encountered a lot of bugs. will take a shot at it after doing some other dummy-finetunes as a way to familirise with hf datasets, tokenizers and transformer sdks. <br/> 
        today i am going to try and finetune harmonai/dance-diffuer and play around with it. let's see how it goes. <br/>
